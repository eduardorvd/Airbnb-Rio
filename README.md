## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the Airbnb data from a city of Brazil, country where I currently reside. The only data available for Brazil was from Rio de Janeiro. Once I used the Airbnb platform to search for house/apartments to rent in Rio and I notice a huge price difference between them, mainly between different neighborhoods. I used this fact as a starting point in my project.

The proposed questions were:

1)Which neighbourhoods have the best average rating and how the average price influences on that? 

2)The rent price normally increases as the number of people that the house/apartment can accommodate increases? 

3)Is it possible to predict the rent price of a house/apartment based in its main attributes?

The dataset for this project is available at: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook named 'Airbnb Rio.ipynb' available in this github that answers the proposed questions mentioned above. The dataset used in the notebook is also available with the name 'listings.zip'.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Airbnb link available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like.
